# business-aviation-top-routes-dashboard

Dashboard shows most frequently flown routes per selected aircraft and airport

Reporting year: 2019 (last full year of traffic before COVID-19 pandemic)

Color of lines indicates flight volume (darkest shade of grey for most flown route)

Limitations:
Only condsiders flights of aircraft that are listed in aircraft selection
Only top 100 airports are considered for individual views
Slow initial load time because all data needs to be read in from data source
If chosen selection of airport and aircraft is too narrow to return enough data to visualize, the app automatically requires to be reloaded
Excluding airports with less than 10 flights per year under chosen airport and aircraft selection (for reasons of increasing performance of visualization)
